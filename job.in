# the levels of concurrency in the assignment

# Note: only OpenMP codes have interaction with the OMP_NUM_THREADS env variable, 
# non-OpenMP jobs are not affected 

# setting OMP_NUM_THREADS=t has no effect on non-OpenMP jobs

# make use of the OMP_SCHEDULE environment variable to set the thread scheduling 
# algorithm. HW3 asks you to compare static and dynamic scheduling, so select one
# of these two to select a specific thread scheduling algorithm:
# export OMP_SCHEDULE=static
# export OMP_SCHEDULE=dynamic
